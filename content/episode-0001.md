Show Notes

## Limping into the playoffs

Last 4 games of the season they went 1-3. They scored 7 goals but gave up 12. Their last 10 they went 6-3-1-0

From the second period of game 70 vs Ontario on Wednesday April 12 until the second period of game 72 versus Bakersfield, the Firebirds went scoreless. that’s 7 periods in a row! 

The dropped their final 2 games of the season to Bakersfield on the road! This is a team that is starting to struggle at the EXACT wrong time! 

## Matchup with Tucson

They ended the season with 69 points (34 less than the Firebirds!) and I’m still nervous! They played 8 games against Tucson this season going 6-2 (3-1 at home and 3-1 on the Road)

[Game 1](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024047) (4-1) Road W
[Game 2](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024061) (4-3) Road WOT
[Game 3](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024246) (2-7) L
[Game 4](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024251) (4-3) W
[Game 5](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024284) (4-3) W
[Game 6](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024290) (2-3) L
[Game 7](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024449) (5-2) W
[Game 8](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1024626) (3-1) W

On paper this should be a slam dunk for the Firebirds … BUT!

See my analysis of the last 4 games of the regular season for the Firebirds

On the plus side, Tucson last won a game on March 29. They come into the playoffs having lost 7 in a row (0-4-1-2) and the only reason they’re in the playoffs is because they won the tiebreaker with San Jose (25 Regulation Wins vs 23 Regulation Wins). Their last 10 they went 3-4-2-1

## Around the league

(1) Calgary [106] wins the Pacific and gets the first round bye. (2) CV [103] will host (7) Tucson [69], (3) Colorado[90] will host (6) Ontario [74], and (4) Abbotsford [87] will host (5) Bakersfield [78].

(1) Texas [92] wins the Central, and gets a bye along with (2) Milwaukee [89] and (3) Manitoba [84]. The only first round series in the Central is (4) Iowa [79] hosting (5) Rockford [79]

(1) Providence [98] wins the Atlantic and along with(2)  Hershey [97] gets a first round bye. (3) Charlotte [86] will host (6) Lehigh Valley [80] while (4) Springfield [84] will host (5) Hartford [81]

The North Division was won by (1) Toronto [90] who get a bye along with (2) Syracuse [81] and (3) Rochester [81]. The only first round series will be (4) Utica [80] hosting (5) Laval [76]

It blows my FUCKING mind that a team with 103 points has to play in the first round while teams with the following point totals get a bye:

Providence - 98
Hershey - 97
Texas - 92
Toronto - 90
Milwaukee - 89
Manitoba - 84 
Syracuse - 81 (eighty-fucking-one!)
Rochester - 81 (eighty-fucking-one again!)
